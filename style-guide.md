# OpenCP Style Guide

## Project Name

The name of the project is *OpenCP*.

OpenCP stands for Open Control Plane, but it is referred to under the short form `OpenCP`. Where capitalization of the characters as above is not possible, the form `opencp` is acceptable instead.

Referring to OpenCP with CamelCase ("OpenControlPlane") is incorrect.

## Filename and repository name styling

Repositories and files related to OpenCP are recommended to be set up in the form `opencp-<project>` where the project name describes the component being implemented.

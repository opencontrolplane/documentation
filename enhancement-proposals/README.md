# OpenCP Enhancement Proposals

## Introduction

The OpenCP Enhancement Proposal process takes inspiration from the [Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP)](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps). As with KEPs, the intention is to:

- Provide a common structure for proposing changes to OpenCP
- Ensure that the change is discussed in a consistent and equitable manner
- Allow for the creation of a roadmap and medium to long-term project goals based on enhancement proposals
- Keep GitHub issues manageable and discussion within the enhancement proposal where appropriate

## What type of enhancements should be discussed through this mechanism?

Once again broadly in line with KEPs, the type of work to be discussed in an enhancement proposal should include anything that impacts an OpenCP user or provider. In terms of the complexity of the proposal:

> If an enhancement would be described in either written or verbal communication to anyone besides the author or developer, then consider creating a proposal.

However, deeper architectural changes that may not have any inmpact on users' experience with OpenCP may well warrant an enhancement proposal as well, as the archived proposal and discussion can be used as a refernece point for why a decision was made.

## OpenCP Enhancement Proposal template

You can find a [template an Enhancement Proposal here](./0000-opencp-enhancement-proposal-template.md). The template also includes instructions on how to submit the proposal.

## Comments and improvements to the Enhancement Proposal process

We welcome discussion and improvement suggestions to the OpenCP enhancement proposal workflow and structure. As currently written, it is based on the KEP process along with new feature discussion (RFC) internal to Civo.

If you have a suggestion for such an improvement, please raise a new Enhancement Proposal by making a copy of the Template document and raising a Pull Request in the Open Control Plane (Documentation) repository.
